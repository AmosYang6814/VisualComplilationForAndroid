**The blockly-android project is _no longer actively developed_ by the
Google Blockly team. We will continue to review and accept pull requests.
If you are looking to create a new Blockly-based app, we recommend using
the [web version](http://github.com/google/blockly) in a WebView.  We
have also create an
[Android Studio demonstration project](https://github.com/google/blockly/tree/develop/demos/mobile/android)
that does exactly this.**

[Blockly][1] is a library for building drag-and-drop visual editors for
JavaScript and other programming languages.  [Blockly for Android][2] is
a developer preview of Blockly's editor built with standard Android
views and fragments, offering more responsive touch performance and
easier integration in Android apps.

Google is proud to offer Blockly for Android for free and open source
under the [Apache License, version 2.0][4].

Blockly has an active [developer forum][5]. Please drop by and say hello. Show
us your prototypes early; collectively we have a lot of experience and can
offer hints which will save you time.

Help us focus our development efforts by telling us [what you are doing with
Blockly][6]. The questionnaire only takes a few minutes and will help us better
support the Blockly community.
